<h1><center>-: Services :-</center></h1>

<h3>Online Shopping:</h3>

We offer two distinct services for online shopping:
- Mail Orders - Shipped directly to your home via UPS.
- In-Store Pickup - Order and pay online, then pick up in store.

<h3>Online Comparison Shopping:</h3>

Our Price Comparison feature makes it easier than ever for Clark students to get a great deal on textbooks. We 
show our prices right alongside other online retailers. Choose the lowest price, greatest convenience, or safest 
bet- then our one-stop-shop makes it easy to checkout from each retailer, saving you valuable time. 
Please note: the in-store pickup service cannot be used on other retailers' sites.


<h3>Rentals:</h3>

We offer textbook and calculator rentals to help our students save! You can rent in store or on line. All items 
will indicate a rental price if they qualify to be rented. Learn more about important details and requirements 
about our rental program here.


<h3>First Day Digital Access:</h3>

A convenient and cost saving program developed for students enrolled in courses using digital content. When faculty 
elect for First Day Digital Access for their courses, it's a win-win! Students have direct access to required digital 
course materials through Canvas on the first day of the quarter with no additional searching or shopping needed!


<h3>Sell Books at Buyback:</h3>

We’ll buy back as many books as we can from our Clark students! This puts money back in the hands of our students, 
recycles unwanted books, and makes books available for sale at lower prices. This service is provided at the end of 
each quarter during finals week, so don’t miss out on your chance to turn your unwanted books into cash!


<h3>Peer to Peer Textbook Exchange:</h3>

Peer to Peer is a student textbook exchange tool available on-line for Clark students to sell or swap books. We are 
happy to host this service free of charge, but be informed; this tool is not monitored and the store is not involved 
in any way so we cannot guarantee what is bought or sold between individuals. As with any person to person site, use 
caution and take measures to ensure your safety when coordinating an exchange.


<h3>Bookstore Gift Cards:</h3>

We have reloadable gift cards which can be purchased in store or on line. This is a great way to extend support to a 
loved one or make it more convenient for them to shop without you!


<h3>Beverage Bonus Punch Card:</h3>

We have a great deal to reward our loyal customers! When you buy 9 drinks (excludes small water and F'real milkshakes), 
you get the 10th one free! Stop by the bookstore and start your punch card today!


<h3>Convenient Services:</h3>

We offer a number of other convenience services in the store, located on the main campus. Services include Student ID & 
Bus Pass, Notary, Copies, Faxes and Forever Stamps.


<h3>Convenient Items:</h3>

Besides textbooks and required course supplies, we also make a variety of other convenient products available so you can 
get what you need without leaving campus! Categories include sundries, snacks & food items, hot and cold drinks, office & 
presentation supplies, small electronic & sound accessories, calculators, Clark logo items, backpacks, gifts and much more
 all in your main campus store!


<h3>Computers & Software:</h3>

We have partnered to extend educationally priced software & computers with select vendors.
